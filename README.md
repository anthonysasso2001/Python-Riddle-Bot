# Python-Riddle-Bot
riddle game in Python that answers different riddles / problems through basic math algorithms, and lets you guess them in sequence...

**(will put solutions to how I did each module, and functions inside modules later atm too busy with school)

# TODO:
  * finish README by adding other riddles / problems I would like to solve,
  * add some testing that will look at menu and each module's functions (only really experiences with C and C++ tests so we'll see how that goes...)

# Main.py - Main menu for application (call this to start it)
  * main(void)
    - main menu, lets users choose which riddle / problem they would like to select or exit the application (Note* calls each option using import so code looks cleaner)
    - 

# FibonacciSequence.py - Fibonacci sequence functions called by menu, contains three functions,
  * fibonacci(void)
    - main menu for fibonacci itself (choose calculator for the solver, guess for the game / guesser) (Note* may have issues if int gets too big havent tested yet)
  
  * fibonacciGuess(void)
    -
  
  * fibonacciCalculator(length, start)
    -
