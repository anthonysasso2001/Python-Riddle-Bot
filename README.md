# Python-Riddle-Bot
riddle game in Python that answers different riddles / problems through basic math algorithms, and lets you guess them if applicable...

**(will put solutions to how I did each module, and functions inside modules later atm too busy with school)

## TODO:
  * finish README by adding other riddles / problems I would like to solve
  * add some unit tests, and main menu integration tests
  * possibly look at a save / load function for 'scores' that will persist (optional and not really the point, more of a secondary goal)

## Main.py
  **Main menu for application (call this to start it)
  * main(void)
    - main menu, lets users choose which riddle / problem they would like to select or exit the application (Note* calls each option using import so code looks cleaner)
    - 

## FibonacciSequence.py
  **Fibonacci sequence functions called by menu, contains three functions
  * fibonacci(void)
    - main menu for fibonacci itself (choose calculator for the solver, guess for the game / guesser) (Note* may have issues if int gets too big havent tested yet)
  
  * fibonacciGuess(void)
    -
  
  * fibonacciCalculator(length, start)
